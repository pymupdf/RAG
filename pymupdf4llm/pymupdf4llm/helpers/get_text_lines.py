    """Extract the text spans from a TextPage in natural reading sequence.

    All spans roughly on the same line are joined to generate an improved line.
    This copes with MuPDF's algorithm that generates new lines also for spans
    whose horizontal distance is larger than some threshold.

    Result is a sorted list of line objects that consist of the recomputed line
    boundary box and the sorted list of spans in that line.

    This result can then easily be converted e.g. to plain text and other
    formats like Markdown or JSON.

    Args:
        textpage: (mandatory) TextPage object
        clip: (Rect) specifies a sub-rectangle of the textpage rect (which in
              turn may be based on a sub-rectangle of the full page).
        tolerance: (float) put spans on the same line if their top or bottom
              coordinate differ by no more than this value.

    Returns:
        A sorted list of items (rect, [spans]), each representing one line. The
        spans are sorted left to right. Span dictionaries have been changed:
        - "bbox" has been converted to a Rect object
        - "line" (new) the line number in TextPage.extractDICT
        - "block" (new) the block number in TextPage.extractDICT
        This allows to detect where MuPDF has generated line breaks to indicate
        large inter-span distances.
