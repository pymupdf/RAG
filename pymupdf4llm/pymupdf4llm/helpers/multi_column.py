"""
This is an advanced PyMuPDF utility for detecting multi-column pages.
It can be used in a shell script, or its main function can be imported and
invoked as descript below.

Features
---------
- Identify text belonging to (a variable number of) columns on the page.
- Text with different background color is handled separately, allowing for
  easier treatment of side remarks, comment boxes, etc.
- Uses text block detection capability to identify text blocks and
  uses the block bboxes as primary structuring principle.
- Supports ignoring footers via a footer margin parameter.
- Returns re-created text boundary boxes (integer coordinates), sorted ascending
  by the top, then by the left coordinates.

Restrictions
-------------
- Only supporting horizontal, left-to-right text
- Returns a list of text boundary boxes - not the text itself. The caller is
  expected to extract text from within the returned boxes.
- Text written above images is ignored altogether (option).
- This utility works as expected in most cases. The following situation cannot
  be handled correctly:
    * overlapping (non-disjoint) text blocks
    * image captions are not recognized and are handled like normal text

Usage
------
- As a CLI shell command use

  python multi_column.py input.pdf footer_margin header_margin

  Where margins are the height of the bottom / top stripes to ignore on each
  page.
  This code is intended to be modified according to your need.

- Use in a Python script as follows:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from multi_column import column_boxes

  # for each page execute
  bboxes = column_boxes(page, footer_margin=50, no_image_text=True)

  bboxes is a list of pymupdf.IRect objects, that are sorted ascending by their
  y0, then x0 coordinates. Their text content can be extracted by all PyMuPDF
  get_text() variants, like for instance the following:
  for rect in bboxes:
      print(page.get_text(clip=rect, sort=True))
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Hopefully the most reasonable sorting sequence:
        At this point we have finished identifying blocks that wrap text.
        We now need to determine the SEQUENCE by which text extraction from
        these blocks should take place. This is hardly possible with 100%
        certainty. Our sorting approach is guided by the following thought:
        1. Extraction should start with the block whose top-left corner is the
           left-most and top-most.
        2. Any blocks further to the right should be extracted later - even if
           their top-left corner is higher up on the page.
        3. Sorting the identified rectangles must therefore happen using a
           tuple (y, x) as key, where y is not smaller (= higher up) than that
           of the left-most block with a non-empty vertical overlap.
        4. To continue "left block" with "next is ...", its sort key must be
                          Q +---------+    tuple (P.y, Q.x).
                            | next is |
              P +-------+   |  this   |
